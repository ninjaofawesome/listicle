# Listicle:  A sample Node Express HBS server

##  What is this?

Listicle is a test project.  I wanted to try building a node express server from scratch to test my skills.  I also chose handlebars as the templating system.

Listicle shows a list of mock articles (with real links), and works on mobile, tablet and desktop.

## How Can I See This Project In Action?

1. Clone this repository
2. run `npm i` after cd'ing into the directory.
3. run `npm start`.

This should run automatically on localhost:3000

##  What future improvements will be made to listicle?

1. Adding client side Javascript.  Currently there is none working.

2. Use helpers for text transformations, etc.

3. Refining the behavior on all devices.

##  Can I contact you with suggestions?

Sure!  This was a learning experience for me, so I encourage others to fork and PR this if they're interested in contributing.
